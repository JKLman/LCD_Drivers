1. Introduction
This software is designed to operate a standard LCD using a dsPIC30F3013 microcontroller. The concepts for a LCD remain the same
across the range of microcontrollers, so LCD commands, timing, and concepts can be used for other projects.

2. File Contents
Library
	LCD.c
	LCD.h

3. How to start
All the code you need to get running can be found in two places. The Library folder and the Example.c. If you just need to get up and
running, the Example.c has everything you need on the software side. The library was put together from the example and is split up
into ‘.c’ and ‘.h’ files. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED AS A SEPARATE ‘.c’ AND ‘.h’!! The user (you) may need to fix items in the library
folders if they turn out to be problematic.

For using the software, there is a specific order on which code must be run. That has all been detailed out in the
Getting_Started.pdf file.

4.TL; DR on License
License states that anyone can use, modify, and distribute this software at will. There is no warranty with the software so use at
your own risk.
